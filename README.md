# Windows 10 90's Edition

Hello World üëã,

This project is made for [**Hack20**](https://flutterhackathon.com/#/) - International Flutter Hackathon by **Flutron** a team of 3 rocking flutter developers.

We created a website which provides us the imaginary retro look of Microsoft Windows 10. We worked for [![time tracker](https://wakatime.com/badge/github/yashpaneliya/Windows10_90s_Edition.svg)](https://wakatime.com/badge/github/yashpaneliya/Windows10_90s_Edition) to make this website and give it a retro and original look.

We have also provided the link for preview video of the project at the end. Please do check it out!!
